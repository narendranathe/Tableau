# Tableau
Problem Statement: You work at the headquarters for a large retail chain. Your boss wants to analyze product sales and profits over the last four years for the company. You suggest that he use Tableau Desktop to do that. Your boss thinks that's a great idea and wants you to get right on that.

As you start gathering all the data you'll need, you notice that the data has been collected and tracked differently for each region. You also notice a lot of creative data entry in the different files, and that one region even has a separate file for each year!

All required files are attached and the output files after cleaning along with flow files to analyse the data

Work Flow result is in .hyper (or) .csv format to work on easily in tableau or any other tool
